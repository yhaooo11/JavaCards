## Flashcard  Application

My application will center around the concept
of flashcards and allow users to:

- create their own decks of flashcards
- review their flashcards
- see statistics about their progress on decks

As flashcards are primarily used as an aid for memorization, 
this application will be mainly used by students and those
who need to memorize information.

I am interested in making a flashcard application because it is
something that I would use personally. Ever since I discovered the 
power of flashcards in grade 11 summer school, I have been using them
any time I need to memorize something.
