# CPSC 210 Personal Project

## Flashcard  Application

My application will center around the concept
of *flashcards* and allow users to:

- *create/delete/edit* their own decks of flashcards
- *review* their decks of flashcards
- *see statistics* about their progress on decks

As flashcards are primarily used as an aid for memorization, 
this application will be mainly used by *students and those
who need to memorize information.*

I am interested in making a flashcard application because it is
something that I would use personally. Ever since I discovered the 
power of flashcards in grade 11 summer school, I have been using them
any time I need to memorize something.
